A positively-charged metal sphere levitates motionlessly above the surface of the table. While keeping the rest of the system unchanged, which of the following parameters may be varied without changing the cancelation of gravity by the electrostatic repulsion?", "tossup_isShortAns": false, "tossup_MCQoptions": "W) The mass of the sphere\nX) The radius of the sphere\nY) The charge of the sphere\nZ) The strength of the electric field produced by the table", "tossup_answer": "ANSWER: X) THE RADIUS OF THE SPHERE", "tossup_imageURL": null, "bonus_question": " -   \u2013  A loop conductor lies partially in a magnetic field. Identify all of the following three changes to this system with a conductor and a magnetic field that would produce a change in the magnetic flux of the system: 1) Increase the strength of the magnetic field; 2) Rotate the conductor, changing the angle between it and the magnetic field; 3) Increase the area of the conductor that is in the field.", "bonus_isShortAns": true, "bonus_MCQoptions": null, "bonus_answer": "ANSWER: ALL OF THEM", "bonus_image": null}
